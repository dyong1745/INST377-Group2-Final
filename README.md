## Target Browers 
The website was tested on Mozilla FireFox and Google Chrome, so the website should run on successfully on these browers. 

## API 
Litter Visualizer creates visualizations using the LitterTRAK data from the Prince George's County Open Data website. The API endpoint is at https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/9tsa-iner.json.

## Visualizations
Ths website visualizes the type of litter collected in PG County cleanup events by location via a map, while also visualizing the total bags of litter collected based on type of location (e.g. Council District or DPWT Main District) via a bar chart. This map was created using the Leaflet JavaScript library (https://leafletjs.com/) and the chart was made using the Chart.js JavaScript library (https://www.chartjs.org/).

## Problem Statement 
Our actual project is trying to solve an environmental issue dealing with litter collection around PG County. Currently the county has provided a database that can be accessible to anyone that shows all the locations of the types of litter being collected, but it doesn't have a visual pinpointing exactly where it is. Our project will enable users to see visualize roughly the differents parts of PG county has the most litter and the types of litter that are being found using a map. We'll also have a bar chart that specifies what district have the most litter. This will help the county know where roughly they can setup the cleanup events around those areas to encourage the community to clean their environment.
