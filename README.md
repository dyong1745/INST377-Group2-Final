## Target Browers 
The website was tested on Mozilla FireFox and Google Chrome, so the website should run on successfully on these browers. 

## API 
Litter Visualizer creates visualizations using the LitterTRAK data from the Prince George's County Open Data website. The API endpoint is at https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/9tsa-iner.json.

## Visualizations
Ths website visualizes the type of litter collected in PG County cleanup events by location via a map, while also visualizing the total bags of litter collected based on type of location (e.g. Council District or DPWT Main District) via a bar chart. This map was created using the Leaflet JavaScript library (https://leafletjs.com/) and the chart was made using the Chart.js JavaScript library (https://www.chartjs.org/).
