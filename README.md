# Litter Visualizer
This is the hub for all the files that make up our final project for INST 377. The main collaborators are Michael Okeno and Da Yong.

## Target Browers 
The website was tested on Mozilla FireFox and Google Chrome, so the website should run on successfully on these browers. 

## API 
Litter Visualizer creates visualizations using the LitterTRAK data from the Prince George's County Open Data website. The API endpoint is at https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/9tsa-iner.json.

## Visualizations
Ths website visualizes the type of litter collected in PG County cleanup events by location via a map, while also visualizing the total bags of litter collected based on type of location (e.g. Council District or DPWT Main District) via a bar chart. This map was created using the Leaflet JavaScript library (https://leafletjs.com/) and the chart was made using the Chart.js JavaScript library (https://www.chartjs.org/).

## CSS Frameworks
The website was styled using mainly pure CSS, using flexbox to organise the layout of the elements. All the webpages have an tan menu at the top of the page (which includes links to the Home page, About page, and the Github page) as well as an orange footer at the bottom with information about the developers. The Home page houses the map, the chart, and its filters, and all of these are centered on the page.
