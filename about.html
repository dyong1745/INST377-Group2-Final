        <h3>What is <em>Litter Visualizer</em>'s Purpose?</h3>
        <p>
          Litter Visualizer was made to help visualize the trash collection done during cleanup events around 
          Prince George's County. The map displays where different types of litter was collected around PG County,
          while the chart shows the total amount of litter bags collected at different types of locations 
          &#40;e.g. Council District, DPWT Main District, Watershed&#41;. By using the map, users can see
          what types of litter frequently appear in a specific area, which can help future cleanup entities better
          prepare for dealing with unique items in those areas. The chart will show which areas have the most / least 
          bags of litter, similarly allowing cleanup entities to prepare for specific loads and to infer which areas are in greater need of
          cleanup events.
